## Features

- **Pomodoro Technique**: Work for 25 minutes, followed by a short break (5 minutes) or a long break (20 minutes).
- **Visual Countdown**: Keep track of your time with an easy-to-read countdown timer.
- **Progress Tracking**: Earn checkmarks for every completed work session.
- **Start and Reset Buttons**: Easily manage your sessions with intuitive controls.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pomodoro-time-counter.git
cd pomodoro-time-counter
```

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Tkinter is included with most Python installations.

## Image Assets

The `tomato.png` image is used as a visual element in the application. It represents the Pomodoro technique, inspired by the Italian word for tomato. You can find the image in the project directory. If you want to customize the appearance, feel free to replace it with your own tomato-themed image!

## Usage

Run the application using:

```bash
python pomodoro_time_counter.py
```

### Steps to Use

1. **Click "Start"** to begin your work session.
2. **Focus** for 25 minutes! (A countdown will be displayed.)
3. When the timer ends, take a break (5 minutes) or a long break (20 minutes) depending on your progress.
4. **Click "Reset"** to restart your sessions or clear the timer.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Set your working and break intervals with constants.
2. **Timer Management**: The timer alternates between work and break sessions, updating the display.
3. **Checkmarks**: After each completed work session, a checkmark is added to track your progress.

### Example

- **Work Session**: 25 minutes
- **Short Break**: 5 minutes
- **Long Break**: 20 minutes (after every 4 work sessions)
